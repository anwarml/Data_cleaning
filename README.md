# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw data using Python. The provided Jupyter Notebook (`Data_cleaning_project.ipynb`) contains scripts to handle missing values, standardize data formats, and remove inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Features

- Handling missing values (imputation, removal, etc.)
- Standardizing data formats
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies
- Normalizing data for further analysis

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (if visualization is included)

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_cleaning_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform data cleaning.
3. Review the cleaned dataset output.

## File Structure

- `Data_cleaning_project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with cleaning scripts
- `data/` - Directory containing raw datasets (if applicable)
- `output/` - Directory for storing cleaned datasets (if applicable)
